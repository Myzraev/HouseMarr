## Bio
## Early History
Born from the mass bio-vats of Forge Octav on the forge world of Hyphrin Beta, Regulus was among the rare few whose intelligence and aptitude earned them induction into the sacred priesthood of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Destined for a higher form of service to the Omnissiah, he was taught the arcane mysteries of the machine.

For many years, Regulus’ life mirrored that of countless lower-ranking adepts—monotonous and unremarkable. Assigned to the maintenance of a single system or machine, his days were spent in ceaseless toil under the inscrutable oversight of senior Magi. Fortune, however, intervened in the form of Magos Explorator Ronrak Qvyeth, who had been scouring Forge Octav for promising talent before departing on his next voyage into the void. Qvyeth discovered Regulus’ monographs detailing innovative configurations for servitors aboard starships. Intrigued, the Magos investigated further and uncovered Regulus’ remarkable skills in code-scribing and cogitation engramming. While serving under Magos Fabricator Kei Voltiom, Regulus’ work with servitors drew attention when it was noted that those under his purview operated with significantly higher efficiency ratings and required less maintenance—a feat that quickly caught the eye of Explorator Qvyeth. Determined to claim such talent for his exploratory fleet, Qvyeth engaged in a tense series of negotiations, scheming, and bartering with Magos Voltiom. After a significant amount of cogitation cycles -nearly an entire hour in real time- of deliberation Voltiom reluctantly agreed to transfer Regulus to Qvyeth's domain.

Initially apprehensive about the dangers of the deep void, Regulus quickly found wonder and opportunity aboard Qvyeth’s flagship, the Scopertha. Life on a Mechanicus exploratory fleet was demanding, with lower-ranking adepts required to master multiple disciplines to maximize efficiency on the long, perilous journey. Those who failed to meet the Magos’ high standards often faced demotion to menial roles or even excommunication from the Cult Mechanicus. Regulus, however, thrived. His insatiable curiosity and aptitude for sacred study allowed him to excel in diverse fields, earning Qvyeth’s favor and rapid promotion. The early years aboard the Scopertha were ones of growth and accomplishment, marked by tireless learning and service.

But the galaxy is indifferent to the ambitions of mortals. Late into its voyage, the Scopertha stumbled upon an uncharted region of space, where it encountered a hostile xenos race occupying the ruins of an ancient human civilization. Believing the xenos to be little more than squatters, Magos Qvyeth ordered their extermination to reclaim the ruins for study. The decision proved disastrous. The xenos, having reverse-engineered human archeotech, launched a brutal counteroffensive. What was expected to be a swift eradication devolved into a protracted and bloody war. Over several months, Qvyeth’s fleet was bled dry of its skitarii complement, and many ships were either destroyed or critically damaged. Though the xenos suffered devastating losses, they retained enough strength to cripple the Scopertha. Forced into an emergency warp translation, the ship plunged directly into the path of a raging warp storm. The jump lasted mere minutes, but the storm’s capricious nature wrought havoc. The Scopertha emerged half a galaxy away, a shattered, lifeless hulk. A catastrophic gellar field failure had allowed daemons to ravage the ship, leaving only a few dozen survivors. Regulus was among the fortunate few.

Adrift in a remote Imperial system, the Scopertha was soon discovered by scavengers. Unable to stop the looters from stripping the vessel bare, Regulus bargained for safe passage to one of the system’s colonized worlds, offering his expertise in return. Though the act bordered on heresy, it was his only means of survival.

Stranded far from the forge world of his birth and with no hope of returning to Hyphrin Beta, Regulus found himself in obscurity. His credentials held no weight with the local Imperial authorities, and the system’s isolation meant decades might pass before a warp-capable ship arrived. He eked out a living maintaining a decrepit void station above a mining world, his talents sustaining him through months of uncertainty.

Just as despair began to take hold, fate intervened once more. A new vessel translated into the system: a Rogue Trader had arrived.
