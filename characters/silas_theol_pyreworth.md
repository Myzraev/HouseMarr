# Silas Theol Pyreworth
**Master of Whispers**  

As master of whispers to the house of Marr it is no surprise that Lord Pyreworth is one of Nikkolo Marr's closest confidants and advisors, perhaps second only to Seneschal Trevaan. Taciturn, paranoid and secretive, Pyreworth embodies the stereotype of spymaster. The extent and reach of House Marr's intelligence network is known only to him and his master the Lord Marr.

Although it is unknown exactly how the Lord Marr managed to obtain such a powerful candidate, Silas was in fact formally given to House Marr by the Scholastia Psykana. He is an exceptionally powerful telepath.
