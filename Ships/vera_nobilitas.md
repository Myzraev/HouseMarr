# Vera Nobilitas
**Type**: Cruiser  
**Class**: Sojourn 
**Affiliation**: House Marr  

This ancestral vessel of House Marr once held the esteemed position of flagship until it yielded that honor to the Maleficar. Despite its venerable age, the ship has only recently entered active combat service, now stationed in low orbit above Planet Achanor. Here, it fulfills the vital role of flagship for the system defense fleet and occasionally serves as an embassy to host foreign dignitaries.

Since its retirement, it has been repaired and refurbished extensively, its hull and halls decorated in the extravagance and luxury; echoing House Marr's now almost forgotten past.
