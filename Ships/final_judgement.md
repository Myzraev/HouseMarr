# Final Judgement
**Type**: Battle Barge  
**Class**: Mars-pattern Mk. II  
**Affiliation**: House Marr  

Principal asset of House Marr's fleet, specializing in planetary bombardment and the rapid deployment of ground forces. Originally a Battle Barge known as the Viator Magnificum, it carries a legacy of relentless warfare. Equipped with formidable weaponry and troop deployment capabilities, it is designed to strike decisively from orbit, ensuring House Marr's dominance on contested worlds. The shipâ€™s storied history and extensive modifications reflect its current role as both a symbol of power and a vital tool in expanding House Marr's influence across the Crucis Reach.

## History
Formerly known as the Viator Magnificum, it once served as a Battle Barge under the Astral Hammers chapter of the Adeptus Astartes.

The Viator's construction began on Mars' Iron Ring at the outset of the 41st millennium. Martian records indicate its commission to compensate for the Astral Hammers' simultaneous loss of both their battle-barges during a particularly punishing crusade from which they never fully recovered.

Nearly 800 years later, amidst vague details, the Astral Hammers faced excommunication by the Inquisition, the chapter hunted down after their homeworld was razed. The Viator Magnificum's last known activity involved a desperate emergency warp translation under heavy fire. Reports from the inquisitorial task force suggested the ship likely suffered catastrophic damage during this attempt. It vanished from Imperial space, deemed lost to the warp along with the remnants of the Astral Hammers in the year 904.M41.

However, an Adeptus Mechanicus reclamation fleet, commissioned by House Marr, recovered the Viator Magnificum in an uncharted star system, more than a hundred years after its disappearance. Escorted by the Vera Nobilitas, the reclamation fleet provided repairs and a skeleton crew for the Viator, just enough to make it space-worthy; once it was moved to the forge world of Hyphrin Beta's void docks, the ship underwent full repairs and retrofitting to House Marr's specifications.

Facing Inquisition scrutiny due to its past owners' traitorous status, an inquest into the ship's discovery raised questions about the ship itself and how Nikkolo Marr obtained its location. Despite comprehensive searches during the ship's restoration, no evidence of corruption was found, it was noted however that the ship's cogitators were wiped before arriving at Hyphrin Beta, supposedly due to combat damage during its escape. The ship, reconsecrated as the Final Judgement, was allowed into service.

With the Viator's previous owners eradicated, the Hyphrin Beta priesthood legitimized it as salvage, acknowledging House Marr's ownership. This acknowledgment was further ratified by the Administratum.
