# Crucis Reach
*Segmentum Ultima*

Crucis Reach stands as a strategically positioned Imperial sector at the heart of the Ultima Segmentum, closely adjacent to the Cicatrix Maledictum. Rediscovered during the midpoint of the 41st millennium, this nascent sector, only half a millennium old, boasts remarkable abundance in natural resources. Today, it finds itself at the nexus of emergent warp routes formed post-Maledictum. The sector's heightened significance has sparked a surge of attention, initiating a veritable "gold rush" as efforts to colonize uncharted systems and enhance existing ones are underway.

## History
Founded by the rogue trader Kamogan Crucis in the early second half of the 41st millennium. Kamogan was a zealous adherent of the Imperial Creed. Initiating colonization as a grand pilgrimage for his dynasty, the goal was to expand humanity's frontiers in honor of Saint Cadrius, believed to be lost in the warp within the sector. The initial colonization fleet, generously supported by the Ecclesiarchy, saw a substantial investment in the Crucis dynasty resources. In just a few decades over a hundred systems were successfully colonized, flourishing and sowing the seeds for humanity's expansion in the sector.
